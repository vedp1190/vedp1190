### Hi there 👋

<!--
**vedp1190/vedp1190** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

👋 Hey I'm Ved, a Systems Design Engineering Student at University of Waterloo. I'm currently looking for Software Development Intern opportunities for Summer 2024!

💻 Currently I am learning and getting better at my technical skills with Python and working on ML projects

📈 Each project is a stepping stone for learning and growth. I actively pursue challenges that stretch my capabilities, constantly seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of what I can achieve.

☀️ In my free time, I love to play soccer, go on a new adventure, or sit back and listen to some music!
