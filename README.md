### Hey, I am Ved 👋

👋 I'm a Systems Design Engineering Student at University of Waterloo. I'm currently looking for Software Development Intern opportunities for Fall 2025!

👨🏽‍💻 This Winter I was a SWE Intern @ Wealthsimple. Previously I have also interned at Manulife Financial as a SWE Intern, Escape as a SWE intern and Viral Nation as ML intern.

💻 Currently I am learning and getting better at my technical skills with Python and working on ML projects.

📈 Each project is a stepping stone for learning and growth. I actively pursue challenges that stretch my capabilities, constantly seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of what I can achieve.

☀️ In my free time, I love to play soccer, go on a new adventure, or sit back and listen to some music!
